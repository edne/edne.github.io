## Short Bio & Technologies
During the high-school I get interested in computer and I learned on my own to
code in some programming languages from **C** to **Java**.

In the bachelor years I start coding in **Python** and entered in a student
association (**POuL**, _Politecnico Open unix Labs_), that aims to promote
**Free Software** in the university giving courses and lectures about
programming, **GNU/Linux** system administration and open source projects.

I was vice-president in the year 2015-2016 and remained active in the following
years, organizing activities and giving lectures, in particular for the annual
_"Python Courses"_.

After the bachelor I spent a year following courses from the master in
_Computer Science Engineering_, with particular interest for functional
programming and compiler courses.

Then I attended a Master in _Electronic technologies for Biomedical
Engineering_, coding **Python**, **C++** and sometimes **Clojure** in the spare
time.

In 2019 I completed the studies with a thesis on _Computational Neurosciences_,
developing a biologically-inspired whisker system for a virtual mouse inside
the **Neurorobotics Platform**, a software framework part of the Human Brain
Project infrastructure. The work comprehended the use of **ROS** to develop
robotic controllers and the **NEST Simulator** to define and interact with
**Spiking Neural Networks**.

From 2019 to the first half of 2020 I worked as researcher at _University of
Pavia_, developing spiking neural networks models and experiments for cerebellar
motor learning.
