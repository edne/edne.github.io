## Short Bio & Technologies
During the high-school I get interested in computer and I learned on my own to
code in some programming languages from **C** to **Java**.

In the bachelor years I start coding in **Python** and entered in a student
association (**POuL**, _Politecnico Open unix Labs_), that aims to promote **Free
Software** in the university giving courses and lectures about programming,
**GNU/Linux** system administration and open source projects.

I was vice-president in the year 2015-2016 and I'm still active, organizing
activities and giving lectures, in particular for the annual _"Python
Courses"_.

After the bachelor I spent a year following courses from the master in _Computer
Science Engineering_, with particular interest for functional programming and
compiler courses.

Now I am attending a Master in _Electronic technologies for Biomedical
Engineering_, coding **Python**, **C++** and sometimes **Clojure** in the spare
time.
