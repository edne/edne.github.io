## Short Bio & Technologies
During high school I learned **C**, and I used it for my
thesis (some Wolfram 1D automata, the classical Game Of Life and a small
environment simulator).

During the bachelor I moved to Linux and started writing **Python**, now I give
lectures about it with my student association (we organize every year the
"Python Courses" inside the _Politecnico di Milano_)

After the bachelor I spent a year following courses from the master in Computer
Science Engineering, the ones that I most enjoyed were _Code Transforming and
Optimization_ and _Principles of Programming Languages_.

With the programming languages course I learned the basics of **Haskell** and I
discovered functional programming, immediately moving to **Lisp(s)** in particular
**Hy**, a Clojure-flavoured Python.

Now I am attending a Master in Biomedical Engineering and in the spare time
practicing with **Clojure**.


## Memberships & Projects
* **POuL**: Politecnico Open unix Labs ([poul.org](https://poul.org)), student
  association, LUG and hackerspace inside the _Politecnico di Milano_.  We
  organize courses and lectures about programming, system administration and,
  once a year, privacy and security.
  I am an active member since 2014 and I was vice-president in the year 2015-2016.

* **Pineal**: a Graphic Synthesis Engine, my personal project for the last
  years, it is a framework to live-code visuals at concerts and parties.
  Currently made by a Lisp-DSL embedded in a C++ backend, communicating with
  third-parties via the OSC protocol.
