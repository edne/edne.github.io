## Why
The final goal is (or may be) doing something at a very high level,
possibly live, typing code inside a
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
or reloading a file.

There are already many bindings for OpenFramework in high level
languages, at least two: one in [Python](https://github.com/chaosct/ofxPython)
and one in [Lua](https://github.com/danomatika/ofxLua).
But they are both based on [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) and merely expose the OF
primitives to an other language, so you have basically two drawbacks:

- dealing with the same (quite low level) constructs: lines, polygons, etc...
- performances of Lua or Python

## Embedding
Most of the scripting languages can interact with something at a lower level,
typically written in C or C++.

Three are two main ways to do this: __extending__ and __embedding__. Extending
consists in write and compile an external library with all your functions, and
than import it as a module from your script.

With embedding, instead, your application itself became the interpreter and you
can expose functions as builtins.

From our point of view should be nice keep the structure of a standard
OpenFramewors, define some high level constructs and then call them from a live
environment, so the best choice can be embedding.

## Lisp
But both Python and Lua can be embedded, in particular Lua is very suited for
that, so why using an ancient and strange-looking language like Scheme?

I don't want to enter in details here, but Scheme, being part of the Lisp
family, permits to easily reprogram its own syntax and so create
[Domain Specific Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
to any kind of application.

One of the most powerful environments for live-coding,
[Fluxus](http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/) (now unmaintained) is itself a Scheme DSL
build on top of a C++ backend.


## Guile
Scheme is ad ancient language, there are a lot of specification, and a lot of
different interpreters, few of them maintained. One of them,
[Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/), is actively developed by the
[GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/) (the guys behind gcc, Emacs, GIMP, gdb,
a large part of the GNU/Linux OS and many other things) and explicitly
designed to be embedded inside applications.


## Start embedding
I am starting with Guile in this days, and a tutorial I found useful
to start embedding is the
[Tutorial Introduction to Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/docs/guile-tut/tutorial.html).
The main concepts can be reduced to the following snippet of code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <libguile.h>

SCM hello_world() {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}

void* register_functions(void* data) {
  scm_c_define_gsubr("hello-world", 0, 0, 0, &hello_world);
  return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  scm_with_guile(&register_functions, NULL);
  scm_shell(0, NULL); 
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

We are defining an `hello_world` function which take non arguments and
returns an "unspecified" `SCM` value. Then we expose it with
`scm_c_define_gsubr`, binding it to the `"hello-world" name.
At the end we run a Scheme shell.

After compiling it with:
```bash
gcc $(guile-config compile) $(guile-config link) hello.c -o hello 
```
(you  have to [have Guile installed](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/download/))
You can run the program an call the `hello-world` function.

```scheme
> (hello-world)
Hello World!
```

You can notice the unusual way to call functions, in Lisp most of
the syntax (various brackets, commas, colons, semicolons...) are
replaced with simple parentheses. So function call like `f(a, b)`
became `(f a b)`.

Type `(quit)` to exit

## Readline
[GNU Readline Library](https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)
is a library used in interpreters and shells, such as Python
or Bash, to do autocompletion with TAB, or scrolling the history using
arrows. To enable it put this lines in the main:

```c
scm_c_eval_string("(use-modules (ice-9 readline))");
scm_c_eval_string("(activate-readline)");
```

## OpenFrameworks
Let's try now to embed Guile in a OpenFrameworks app.  First of all if
you build with Make you have to uncomment and set in the `config.make`
file:

```makeile
PROJECT_LDFLAGS = `guile-config link`
```

and:

```makefile
PROJECT_CFLAGS = `guile-config compile`
```

If you use an other build system or some IDE like Codeblocks, XCode or
Visual Studio I'm sorry but you have to find by yourself how to set
this variables (and maybe write it in the comments so I can update
this post).

Now we can add in `ofApp.h`:

```cpp
#include <libguile.h>
```

And in `ofApp.cpp`:

```cpp
SCM hello_world() {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}

void* register_functions(void* data){
  scm_c_define_gsubr("hello-world", 0, 0, 0, (scm_t_subr)(&hello_world));
  return NULL;
}

void ofApp::setup(){
  scm_with_guile(&register_functions, NULL);

  scm_c_eval_string("(use-modules (ice-9 readline))");
  scm_c_eval_string("(activate-readline)");

  scm_shell(0, NULL); 
}
```

In `scm_c_define_gsubr` we have to explicitly cast the type of
`&hello_world` (the address of the memory where the `hello_world`
machine code is actually stored) to `scm_t_subr` to avoid problems
with the C++ compiler.

Now we can compile and run it, we can call the `hello-worls` but it
doesn't display any window. This because the `scm_shell` function runs
its own main loop, blocking OpenFramework to start. We have to run it
in a different thread.


## Threading
Threads are a way to run instructions "in parallel",
[here](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/utils/ofThread/) there is
the OF documentation explanation of the concept with some code.

To use them in our app we ave to define a new class in `ofApp.h` and
create a instance of it in our `ofApp`:

```cpp
class ReplThread : public ofThread{
  public:
    void threadedFunction();
};

class ofApp : public ofBaseApp{
  private:
    ReplThread replThread;

  public:
    void setup();
    ...
};

```

In `ofApp.cpp` we move the code from `setup` to the `threadedFunction` method
of our new class, and in `setup` start the thread.

```cpp
void ReplThread::threadedFunction(){
  scm_with_guile(&register_functions, NULL);

  scm_c_eval_string("(use-modules (ice-9 readline))");
  scm_c_eval_string("(activate-readline)");

  scm_shell(0, NULL);
}

void ofApp::setup(){
  replThread.startThread();
}
```

## Something graphical
Now we can put away the `hello_world` and do something a bit more
interesting, like setting the background.

```cpp
SCM background(SCM r, SCM g, SCM b){
  ofBackground(255 * scm_to_double(r),
               255 * scm_to_double(g),
               255 * scm_to_double(b));
  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}

void* register_functions(void* data){
  scm_c_define_gsubr("background",  3, 0, 0, (scm_t_subr)(&background));
  return NULL;
}
```

The function `scm_to_double` cast the `SCM` variables to actual
numbers and the second argument of `scm_c_define_gsubr` is the number
of required arguments, in this case 3.


## Multithreading problem
I you try to go further you will immediately notice something: you can
not draw anything form the REPL thread. For example exposing a
`circle` function:

```cpp
SCM circle(SCM x, SCM y, SCM r){
  ofFill();
  ofSetCircleResolution(100);
  ofDrawCircle(scm_to_double(x),
               scm_to_double(y),
               scm_to_double(r));
  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}
```

```cpp
scm_c_define_gsubr("circle", 3, 0, 0, (scm_t_subr)(&circle));
```

And calling it, nothing appears on the screen.

Probably there is a way to fix it, but there is also a simple
workaround: we can avoid completely the need of a second thread.
Now we are writing commands in a "live shell" but we can also write
a sketch file and ask OF to reload it every time is changed.

The easiest (but inelegant) solution is to put a `sketch.scm` file in the
`bin/` folder and reload it each frame:

```cpp
void ofApp::draw(){
  scm_c_eval_string("(load \"sketch.scm\")");
}
```

## Sample implementation

Here an example with some primitives exposed (the `.h` can be the
default one unchanged):

```cpp
#include "ofApp.h"
#include <libguile.h>

SCM background(SCM r, SCM g, SCM b){
  ofBackground(255 * scm_to_double(r),
               255 * scm_to_double(g),
               255 * scm_to_double(b));
  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}

SCM set_color(SCM r, SCM g, SCM b){
  ofSetColor(255 * scm_to_double(r),
             255 * scm_to_double(g),
             255 * scm_to_double(b));
  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}

SCM circle(SCM x, SCM y, SCM r){
  ofFill();
  ofSetCircleResolution(100);
  ofDrawCircle(scm_to_double(x),
               scm_to_double(y),
               scm_to_double(r));
  return SCM_UNSPECIFIED;
}

void* register_functions(void* data){
  scm_c_define_gsubr("background", 3, 0, 0, (scm_t_subr)(&background));
  scm_c_define_gsubr("set-color",  3, 0, 0, (scm_t_subr)(&set_color));
  scm_c_define_gsubr("circle",     3, 0, 0, (scm_t_subr)(&circle));
  return NULL;
}

void ofApp::setup(){
  scm_with_guile(&register_functions, NULL);

  // Load and start gnu-readline, library for history and autocompletion
  scm_c_eval_string("(use-modules (ice-9 readline))");
  scm_c_eval_string("(activate-readline)");
}

void ofApp::draw(){
  scm_c_eval_string("(load \"sketch.scm\")");
}
```

And a simple sketch drawing a black circle on a blue background:

```scheme
(background 0 0.4 1)
(set-color 0 0 0)
(circle 40 40 20)
```

## What's next
I have no idea of where we can go exploring and combining this
instruments.

My current plan is to start working with
my [artist collective](http://www.codiceinutile.org/) on a some sort
of collaborative DSL, but the project is not even defined yet and now
I am just playing with the technology and sharing the know-how.  We
are open to any kind of suggestion or contribution, so feel free to
share feedback, ideas or code.

Happy hacking.
